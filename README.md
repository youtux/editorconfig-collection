# A collection of `.editorconfig` templates

This is a collection of [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org) file templates.

## Folder structure

The files in the root directory are for `.editorconfig` templates that are
project specific, such as language or framework specific templates.

## Contributing workflow

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your forkâ€™s branch to my `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
